2. Do not use any eCommerce frameworks which are already available. Example for such frameworks for react are [moltin](https://www.moltin.com/blog/2017/03/react-js/), [nicistore](https://github.com/yoonic/nicistore). Please do not use such frameworks.
3. Using css preprocessors like less, sass; task runners like grunt, gulp would plus point.
4. Please implement the design as it is! (This doesn't hold you back from changing the text or messages in the app - feel free to change the english as you want)

### Functional requirements:

- Show list of items and "Your cart" sections as shown in the below image. If none of the items are added to your cart, show message in the "Your cart" section as shown in the below image.

   **NOTE:** Data for item list should be passed through json, do not directly hard code the data items in the html.

- User can add or remove items to Cart by clicking on Plus and Minus icons from both "Your cart" section and from the item itself. Price in the "Your cart" section changes dynamically as number of items changes.

- Show progress-bar above the "Your cart" section as shown in the below image. This progress bar will be filled up dynamically as the items added to/ removed from Cart, where 100% filled progress-bar indicates the Rs. 2000/-.

  **For example:**

  - If the total amount of your cart is Rs. 100/- then 5% of progress bar will be filled.
  - If the total amount of your cart is Rs. 450/- then 22.5% of progress bar will be filled.
  - If the total amount of your cart is more than Rs. 2000/- then 100% of progress-bar will be fiiled.
